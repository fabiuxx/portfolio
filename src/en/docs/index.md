<em>B.Sc. Computer Science - Software Engineer</em>

I specialize in the *full-stack* design and implementation of custom software platforms to address different industry challenges in different sectors. My experience focuses mainly on the *backend* of these platforms, ensuring that the foundation is solid enough to extend and build other solutions on top of it. On the other hand, I have experience in the development of native and hybrid mobile applications, creation of web interfaces and multiplatform desktop software (windows/linux) to connect end users with the implemented services and close the operational loop. Able to execute projects individually and/or with people under my supervision.
